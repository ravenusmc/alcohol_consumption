# Alcohol Consumption Rates 
## Intro 

This is a project that I am making because after I finished my pydata project I essentially ran out of ideas to what I wanted to work on next with data. I was looking through some csv files on the fivethirtyeight repo and either the files that they had were to large for me to take on at the moment or I was not interested. 
I also needed a project that got me away from making line graphs and move into something else-like bar charts or something. So, this should be a fun project that will also help me keep my Pydata skills sharpened! 

# Getting started
